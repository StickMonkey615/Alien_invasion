Alien invasion game

----------OVERVIEW----------
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears 
at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys aliens acquiring points for each one shot. If the player 
shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than 
the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches
the bottom of the screen the player loses a ship. If the player 
loses three ships then the game ends.
